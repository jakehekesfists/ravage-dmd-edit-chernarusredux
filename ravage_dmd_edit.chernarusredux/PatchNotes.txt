A quick word: 
Upon first spawn, if you don't have a saved character in the database. your character will briefly spawn and then die.
This is expected behaviour.
Have tested this mission both as player hosted multiplayer on LAN, and as a dedicated server using TADST.
Persistence seems functional on both. But will require further testing to be certain. 
I still do not recommend this for use on a dedicated server unless you know what you are doing.
